## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattkuda/nextjs-starter.git
cd nextjs-starter
npm install -f
```

## Running Locally

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api_key
CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_backend_api_key
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_clerk_webhook_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NGROK_URL=your_ngrok_public_url
```

### 2. Set Up Ngrok for Webhook Testing

First, make sure you have [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) installed and authenticated (see Prerequisites section above).

Start your local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a separate terminal window, start ngrok to create a public tunnel to your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Ngrok will display output similar to this:
```
Session Status                online
Account                       your-email@example.com
Version                       3.x.x
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       -
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://abc123def456.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3000
```

Copy the `https://abc123def456.ngrok-free.app` URL (your URL will be different). You'll need this URL for configuring webhooks in the next steps.

> **Important**: Keep the ngrok terminal window open while testing. If you restart ngrok, you'll get a new URL and need to update your webhook configurations again.

### 3. Configure Clerk

1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and create a new application by clicking the **"+ Add application"** button
2. Choose your application name and click **"Create application"**
3. In the **Overview** section, you'll see the API keys you need:
   - Copy `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and paste it into your `.env.local` file
   - Copy `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and paste it into your `.env.local` file
4. Next, go to the **Configure** tab in the left sidebar
5. Click **"Webhooks"** in the left sidebar, then click the **"+ Add Endpoint"** button
6. For the endpoint URL, paste in your ngrok URL followed by `/api/auth/webhook`. For example: `https://abc123def456.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/webhook`
7. In the **"Events"** section, select the checkbox for these events:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated` 
   - `user.deleted`
8. Click **"Create"** to save the webhook
9. Copy the **"Signing Secret"** value and paste it into your `.env.local` file as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 4. Configure Supabase

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and click **"Start your project"** or **"Sign In"** if you already have an account
2. Once logged in, click **"+ New project"** 
3. Choose your organization, enter a project name, database password, and select a region
4. Click **"Create new project"** and wait for the project to be set up (this may take a few minutes)
5. Once ready, go to **Settings** in the left sidebar, then click **"API"**
6. Copy the following values to your `.env.local` file:
   - Copy the **"Project URL"** and paste it as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Copy the **"service_role secret"** key and paste it as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
7. Go to the **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar and click **"+ New query"**
8. Copy the commands from [`docs/db-design.md`](docs/db-design.md) and paste them into the query editor
9. Click **"Run"** to execute the query

### 5. Configure OpenAI

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and click **"Sign up"** or **"Log in"** if you already have an account
2. Once logged in, click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select **"Your profile"** 
3. In the left sidebar, click **"User API keys"** 
4. Click **"+ Create new secret key"**
5. Give your key a name (e.g., "NextJS SaaS App") and click **"Create secret key"**
6. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately and paste it into your `.env.local` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - You won't be able to see this key again, so make sure to save it now
7. Make sure you have billing set up by going to **"Billing"** in the left sidebar and adding a payment method

### 6. Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## Testing the Setup

1. Use the sign-up page to register a new user
2. Confirm the user is created in Clerk and synced to Supabase via webhooks
3. Verify webhook events in Ngrok's dashboard at [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040)
4. Test the dashboard features and subscription flows

## Going to Production

When you're ready to deploy your SaaS application to production, follow these steps:

### Set up production webhooks

1. Go to the Clerk Dashboard and update your webhook URL to your production domain
2. Configure Stripe webhooks for your production environment
3. Update webhook secrets in your production environment variables

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and deploy it
3. Follow the Vercel deployment process

### Add environment variables

In your Vercel project settings, add all the necessary environment variables for production:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API`: Your production Clerk frontend API key
2. `CLERK_API_KEY`: Your production Clerk backend API key  
3. `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your production Clerk webhook secret
